"""bits cvmfs-publish — producer-side staged publish of a build's packages.

This is the Python home for what cvmfs-prepub-publish.yml did per package in
bash: resolve the CVMFS path from the package's own .meta.json, untar, relocate,
relativise absolute symlinks, sanitize, tar, stage (bits cvmfs-stage) and submit
to prepub. Concentrating it here lets the packages of one build be prepared
CONCURRENTLY and biggest-first — the measured lever for publish time — with a
real thread pool instead of hand-rolled bash fan-out, and with unit tests.

Increment 1 (this file): the SINGLE-package pipeline `publish_one`, proven to
reproduce the CI's output (same staging prefix + catalog hash) for one package.
The concurrent biggest-first driver is added next, on top of this.
